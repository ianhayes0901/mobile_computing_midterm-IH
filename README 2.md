# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Ian Hayes**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Name of your app** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes that function as intended! For my demo, I recorded it on September 18th to demo the "give the current day value" function, and I declared my favorite number as 124! 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **📲🌈🔢**
